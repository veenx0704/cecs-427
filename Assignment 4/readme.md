# Assignment 4: Market Strategy Algorithm

I am on **Mac OS** so please adjust your commands accordingly.

## 1. Locate the .py file:

Use your local terminal and locate .py directories.
I put mine in my Documents/427/prog/.py:

```bash
cd Documents
cd 427
cd prog4
```

## 2. Sample Commands:


To execute the `market_strategy.py` script in the current directory, use the `market.gml` file for analysis. The file should be in Graph Modelling Language (.gml) format, containing nodes and edges with attributes for the program to read.
```python
python3 ./market_strategy.py market.gml --plot --interactive
```
## 3. Command-Line Arguments:

- `<filename>`: Path to the `.gml` file. 
- `--plot`: Visualize the graph. 
-  `--interactive`: Step through rounds interactively. Close window to go for next rounds

## Note:
Please zoom in the graph, they may look overlapped but they are not:)
